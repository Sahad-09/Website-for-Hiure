 A passionate learner of new things I graduated in Physics and followed my academic career attending a Masters in Materials Science at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) and after starting my PhD in Physics I realized that my life was more about communities than academia.
I followed my dream of working with technologies and helped found the  <a style="color:blue" href="https://sitiodoastronauta.com.br" target="_blank">Sitio do Astronauta - Arte e tecnologia LTDA</a> a collective for the study and development of science and technologies that drives learning experiences and artistic expression. Always aiming to reconcile craft techniques, simple materials and electronics to enhance the construction of objects with accessible technologies, referring to their needs focused on self-development and collective work. The collective has become popular through the promotion of seminars and workshops inspired by the do-it-yourself culture.

As this work was one of those selected in the  <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/makers/" target="_blank">MakersEduca of the Lemann foundation</a>, for makers initiatives in the community. The activities developed join the Sobradinho State school.
He was also selected to compose the Creative Learning Institute with the research group  <a style="color:blue" href="https://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/4633/" target="_blank">Lemann Creative Learning</a> of MIT MediaLab.
Founder of the space to do, at  <a style="color:blue" href="http://institutopandavas.org.br" target="_blank">pandavas institute</a>, with the mission to develop skills through free doing based on the safe use of tools and equipment.

Which led to projects like <a style="color:blue" href="https://cabinetecnomistica.com.br" target="_blank">Cabine Tecnomistica</a>, which is an offshoot of the Tecnomisticismo project made by the <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tkY-XSw-0" target="_blank">Sesc Arts circuit 2017</a>, which seeks to bring technology through a liguage of mysticism.
And more recently from the reflection on the use of 3D printers and the use of plastics, the <a style="color:blue" href="https://plasticomaravilha.com.br" target="_blank">Wonder Plastic project</a>

Having several field experiences, he has worked in the execution of several installations by coolab in the village facilities of Boa vista in Ubatuba-SP, Portal Sem Porteiras in Monteiro Lobato -Sp and has been doing a study for a new community network in <a style="color:blue"  href="http://blog.altermundi.net/article/coolab-visita-tecnica-guyana-wapichan/" target="_blank">Shulinab in Guyana</a>. Organized the <a style="color:blue"  href="http://www.coolab.org/2018/01/20/coolab-camp-redes-livres-mao-na-massa/" target="_blank">coolabcamp</a> an immersion for horizontal knowledge exchange about community networks. Participated in the <a style="color:blue"  href="http://cnsig.info/cumbre/lac/2018/09/17/Cumbre-Latinoamericana.html" target="_blank">First Latin American Summit of Community Networks</a> and the <a style="color:blue"  href="https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-0" target="_blank">IGF 2018</a>.
